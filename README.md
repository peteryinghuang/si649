# DataViz Final Project

Welcome to my final project. This repository contains the data and code used to analyze historical performances of the most successful Olympic teams, often referred to as "Dream Teams," across various sports disciplines.

## Project Description

This project aims to quantify and visualize the dominance of top-performing countries in the history of the Olympic Games. Using a combination of Jupyter Notebooks, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we've created an interactive analysis that looks at medal counts, contribution rates, and historical changes in Olympic performances.

## Repository Structure

- `.github/workflows`: Contains GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD processes.
- `js`: JavaScript files used for data processing and visualization.
- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the data analysis and visualization code.
- `dictionary.csv`, `summer.csv`, `winter.csv`: Data files containing Olympic statistics.
- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the web visualization.

## Data Source

The data used in this analysis is sourced from the [Official Olympic Games Website](https://www.olympic.org) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com), offering a comprehensive look at the historical data of the Olympics.

## Usage

To view the visualization:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `index.html` file and open it in a web browser.
